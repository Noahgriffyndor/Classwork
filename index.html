Comments about title and style are below, putting too many breaks in code broke my style element-->
<title>Ancient Aliens</title>  
<style> body {  background-color: Rgb(200,150,120);margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; text-align: center} 
p { width: auto; max-width: 1200px; display: inline-block; text-align:left;}
h1 { text-align: center; text-transform: uppercase; border-bottom: 3px solid Rgb(200,40,40); margin-top: 40px;} 
h2 {color: Rgb(200,40,40);text-align: center;}   
h3 { text-align: center; font-size: 28px; border-top: 1px solid Rgb(200,40,40); margin-top: 40px; margin-bottom: 5px}
h4 { text-align: center; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 5px}
.hght {height: 300px; width: auto;} 
a:link {color: blue; }
a:visited {color: purple; }
a:hover {color: white; background-color: black }
</style>
<!-- Title is "Ancient Aliens
Style start and setting the background color to dark peach color. Also aligned the page to the center.
P I wanted centered margins but text aligned left. So I centered all body content, added max width, then aligned text left.
h1 is centered, all caps, has a border below it, and added space from the top margin. 
h2 is red and centered. 
h3 is dividing the mars theme from the information about myself, will probably make these two different pages at some point 
.hght is for making photo heights flush for when they are next to each other 
a: setting up the colors for link color, visited color, and hover color -->

<!-- Header 1 includes a picture, line break, and the words “Aliens on Mars!!” -->
<h2>Ancient Cilivations</h2>
<!-- Header 2 -->
<p>The pyramids on Mars are proof that there was ancient civilations.  
The martians that built pyramids on Mars are the same ones who built the pyramids in Egypt.  
Why Egypt you ask?  Obviously Egypt holds the same climate as Mars, making Egypt the most comfortable environment for the Martians.</p>

<h3>A bit about my self</h3>
<!-- Header 3 to divide from the mars theme -->
<p>My name is Noah Griffin and welcome to my page.  
I am from Arkansas and I joined the Air force 7 years ago and I plan on completing 20 years of service.  
I am well versed in VBA coding in MS Access and I just got my first commission to build a database for a company last week.  
I also just got orders to Japan and I am super excited to leave Oklahoma, no offense to any Okies in the class.</p>
<h4>My hobbies</h4>
<p>My hobbies include working on cars, coding, and 3D printing.  
I was stationed in England for my first base, and what I brought back was a 1992 Rover Mini Cooper(seen below).  
Unfortunately I could not afford repair the rust so I had to sell it.  
Now that I am going to Japan, I plan on getting another project car, a 
<a href="https://ltmotorwerks.com/products/full-rocket-bunny-240sx-s14-v2-boss-conversion-aero-kit">modded</a> 
Nissan 240sx.  I am very excited to start this next chapter in my life and I want to expand on my hobbies while I'm in Japan.
A site I frequently visit for VBA and SQL questions is 
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions">Stack Overflow.</a>
For 3D printing I recommend downloading models from
<a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/">Thingiverse.</a>
